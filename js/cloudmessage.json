    "text": "<i>Skiing is an inherently risky activity</i> - riding a chairlift while skiing shouldn't be.  For state inspection supervisor Hanna Jane, her near invisible job was brought to the forefront of the public eye a year ago. Back then a faulty ski lift stranded a group of kindergarteners for several hours. While no one was hurt, the faces of panic stricken children in the news sprung the political wheels into motion.",

    "text": "A few months later, her division received Ski ACT #47, a set of new regulations, with mandated inspection timelines to insure the safety of citizens and tourist. For years, her organization leveraged paper based processes to make ski lift inspections across the state. While the processes worked, it was error prone and simply could not route the paperwork through the approval chain before the newly mandated timelines expired. Something had to change. Her organization needed to modernize, needed  to execute without costly delays in hardware or software provisioning. They needed to move to the Cloud.",

    "text": "This challenge gave birth to what will be the centerpiece of Hanna's career in public service. In just a few months, her state launched an application called In-View. The application leverages the process automation and mobile technology in the cloud to transform the speed at which her division operates. The cloud seamlessly evolves legacy paper based manual workflows into online, mobile enabled solutions.",

Each morning they are able to login to In-View and in a matter of minutes create a new inspection that collects all the information required by Ski Act #47.  If a particular lift like #12, could have a problem.",

The Policy Automation Cloud Service enables Hanna to work directly with business Analysts, like Joe, to mark-up any new legislation inside a simple Word editor. The markup is then deployed into the cloud and available for In-View business processes to leverage. This insures all future ski lift inspections conform to the new regulations in a matter of hours as opposed to weeks or months.",

The Mobile Cloud Service then leverages the Process Cloud Service for workflow activities which process the Inspection through the approval chain. To process the various laws and policies within Ski-lift inspection we interface with the Oracle Policy Automation Cloud Service which provides the necessary rules for the Inspector to abide by the laws for inspections.",
